# How to get rid of Google

## Service by service

### Emails

To get rid of **Gmail**, you will need : 
- an email server (dedicated or virtual server + a domain name)
- an email client (desktop + mobile)

#### Server

I use Mail-in-a-box, an open-source mail server really easy to install. [Link to the documentation](https://mailinabox.email/) (the video gives a good overview).

The services I use for MIAB : 
- Cloud provider (dedicated server) : Scaleway. Offer Start-3-S-SSD (13.99 â‚¬/month) : Ubuntu 18.04
- Domain Name Registrar : Google Domain (**todo : migrate this one too !**)

#### Client

##### Mobile (Android)

Currently trying [Spark](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readdle.spark&hl=fr&gl=US)

##### Desktop (Linux)
